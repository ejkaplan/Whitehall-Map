# Whitehall-Map
Heatmap for investigators in Whitehall Mystery. Players enter all of their knowledge and the game displays all of the locations where the murderer could hypothetically be. 

## How to use it
Whenever jack makes a move, use the arrow keys to move to the next time slot. If jack just made an alley move, press 2, and the timeline marker will be shaded brown. If jack just made a water move, press 3 and the timeline marker will be shaded blue. Press 1 to switch back to the previous move having been a normal move. If you discover a place where jack has been, left click on it. It will be shaded yellow. (This is also how you will indicate where jack commits the first murder on turn 0.) If you discover a place where jack has NOT been, right click on it. It will be shaded black.

All of the spaces that are outlined in red are places where jack hypothetically could be. If there is only one such space, he is definitely there. If there are no such spaces, you probably accidentally gave contradictory clues.
